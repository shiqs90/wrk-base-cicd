# Claude Development Workflow & CI/CD Implementation Plan

## Standard Workflow Rules

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to todo.md.
2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Make sure to test each Implementation Phase, before moving to next Phase.
8. Never compromise/change the existing functionality or capabilities of the app, in the pursuit to complete your tasks.
9. Always tell me what you are trying to achieve before attempting to make any changes
10. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

# CI/CD Implementation Plan for Distributed Book Management System

## Architecture Overview

The system consists of 5 Node.js services:
- **app-node**: HTTP API gateway service (port 3000)
- **wrk-ork**: Orchestrator service managing other workers
- **wrk-book**: Book management worker service
- **wrk-base**: Base worker functionality
- **tpl-wrk-thing**: Template worker for distributed system

## Implementation Todo List

### Phase 1: Docker Infrastructure
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for app-node service with multi-stage build
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for wrk-ork service with multi-stage build
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for wrk-book service with multi-stage build
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for wrk-base service with multi-stage build
- [ ] Create Dockerfile for tpl-wrk-thing service with multi-stage build
- [ ] Add .dockerignore files for build optimization
- [ ] Test each Docker build individually

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Pipeline
- [ ] Create basic GitHub Actions workflow file
- [ ] Add linting step for all services
- [ ] Add Docker build step for each service
- [ ] Configure branch-based tagging strategy:
  - main � latest
  - dev � development
  - others � alpha-{commit-hash}
- [ ] Add Docker registry push steps
- [ ] Test pipeline with sample commits

### Phase 3: Docker Compose Stack
- [ ] Create basic docker-compose.yml with all 5 services
- [ ] Add service networking and dependencies
- [ ] Add health checks for each service
- [ ] Add Prometheus service configuration
- [ ] Add Grafana service configuration
- [ ] Configure Prometheus scraping targets
- [ ] Test complete stack deployment

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Health Checks
- [ ] Add health check endpoints to services
- [ ] Configure Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Create Grafana dashboard for service monitoring
- [ ] Add basic alerting rules
- [ ] Test monitoring stack functionality

### Phase 5: Documentation
- [ ] Create architecture diagram
- [ ] Write deployment guide (README.md)
- [ ] Document versioning strategy
- [ ] Document rollback procedures
- [ ] Write contribution guidelines
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### Phase 6: Testing & Validation
- [ ] Test complete CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Validate branch-based deployments
- [ ] Test monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Perform rollback testing
- [ ] Final documentation review

## Technical Requirements

### Docker Best Practices
- Use Alpine Linux base images for smaller footprint
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images
- Proper layer caching strategies
- Security scanning integration
- Non-root user execution

### CI/CD Pipeline Features
- Parallel builds for multiple services
- Build caching for faster execution
- Multi-architecture support (amd64/arm64)
- Automated testing integration
- Security scanning
- Artifact management

### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Health check endpoints
- Service discovery configuration
- Alert manager integration
- Log aggregation setup
